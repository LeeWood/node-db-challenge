 Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.
  - A relational database is a system of storing amounts of data where the values of that data are related to the values of the data in sperate areas of the database. SQL, on the otherhand is a query language that is used to talk to relational databases. So Realtional databases is the actual data and SQL is how we interact with that data.
	
 Why do tables need a primary key?
  - Tables need a primary key so each entry has a way to be uniquely identified. This helps with selecting that data when referencing it and keeps a system of order in your tables.

 What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
  - This is called a foreign key.

 What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
  - A many to many relationship is when both tables are not only related to each other, but they are related to many other tables.
